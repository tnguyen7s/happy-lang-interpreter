# The HAPPY language:
This is my final project for my programming langague class, in which I invented a programming language named happyðŸ˜Š. The interpreter for Happy is written in Python.

To run a sample program written in happy, we use:

happy.py filename.happy (also, we need a python interpreter presents in the running environment)

e.g. happy.py sample_programs/quickSort.happy
